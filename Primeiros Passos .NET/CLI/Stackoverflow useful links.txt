1- There is a issue you might face with, which is setting your passphrase every time you make a commit:

2- Launching ssh-agent automatically on Git for Windows

Auto-launching ssh-agent on Git for Windows
You can run ssh-agent automatically when you open bash or Git shell. Copy the following lines and paste them into your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file in Git shell:

------------------------------------------
env=~/.ssh/agent.env

agent_load_env () { test -f "$env" && . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_start () {
    (umask 077; ssh-agent >| "$env")
    . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_load_env

# agent_run_state: 0=agent running w/ key; 1=agent w/o key; 2=agent not running
agent_run_state=$(ssh-add -l >| /dev/null 2>&1; echo $?)

if [ ! "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] || [ $agent_run_state = 2 ]; then
    agent_start
    ssh-add
elif [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && [ $agent_run_state = 1 ]; then
    ssh-add
fi

unset env
-------------------------------------------------------------------
If your private key is not stored in one of the default locations (like ~/.ssh/id_rsa), you'll need to tell your SSH authentication agent where to find it. To add your key to ssh-agent, type ssh-add ~/path/to/my_key. For more information, see "Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent"

Tip: If you want ssh-agent to forget your key after some time, you can configure it to do so by running ssh-add -t <seconds>.

Now, when you first run Git Bash, you are prompted for your passphrase:

> Initializing new SSH agent...
> succeeded
> Enter passphrase for /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa:
> Identity added: /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa)
> Welcome to Git (version 1.6.0.2-preview20080923)
>
> Run 'git help git' to display the help index.
> Run 'git help ' to display help for specific commands.
The ssh-agent process will continue to run until you log out, shut down your computer, or kill the process.





3- Set the above script into .bashrc
